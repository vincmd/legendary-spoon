  This is possibly
  <strong>the most accessible a modal can get</strong>
  , using JavaScript. When opened, it uses
  <code>assets/js/focus-trap.js</code>

  focus won't leak to the elements behind, staying inside the
  modal in a loop, until you take any action.

  Also, on small screens it is placed at the bottom of the screen,
  to account for larger devices and make it easier to click the
  larger buttons.
